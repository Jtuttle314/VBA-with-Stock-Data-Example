# VBA Exercise - The VBA of Wall Street

### Background

Due to system resources, 3 levels of VBA scripting have been created.  “Hard W/ Bonus” is the full script and takes rough 1.5 minutes to run while “Easy” will have the shortest run time.

* Script buttons are located on each sheet and will require Macros to be activated within Excel.
* Multiple_year_stock_data Tuttle.xml is a very large data file and will take time to load. A separate word file has been included to view solution code. 


### Easy

* Create a script that will loop through each year of stock data and display the total trade volume for each stock.

* Display the ticker symbol in column I, and the total volume in column H.

* Your result should look as follows.

### BONUS

* Make the appropriate adjustments to your script that will allow it to run on every worksheet just by running it once.

* You can do the bonus activity regardless of which
